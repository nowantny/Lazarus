# Lazarus source code Version 2.105

Source code base for the Lazarus project.

This includes all source code needed to build the Lazarus gamex86.dll, version
2.105, including the previously-omitted 3dfx header files you'll need for glide fog.

The code compiles fine with MSVC 6.0, and should also work with no problems with MSVC 5.0.
I make no guarantees of success with any other compiler.
